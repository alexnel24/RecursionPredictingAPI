# RecursionPredictingAPI
This repository contains a python script to locally load a tensorflow CNN model and run an API to produce predictions on images of cells. THIS PROJECT WAS DONE DURING ALEX NELSON'S CAPSTONE PROJECT WHILE COMPLETING A MASTER OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH IN 2020.

<br>
This python script loads the model from aws s3 storage. To receive restricted user access to this s3 location, please e-mail Alex at alexander.nelson24@gmail.com with this request.

Here are a list of needed libraries:
1.	sys and os
2.	boto3
3.	Flask and request from flask
4.	tensorflow
5.	numpy
6.	cv2 from opencv-python

A virtual environment is also available with these 6 libraries at the same s3 location
