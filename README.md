# RecursionPredictingAPI
This repository contains a python script to locally load a tensorflow CNN model and run an API to produce predictions on images of cells. 

THIS PROJECT WAS DONE DURING ALEX NELSON'S CAPSTONE PROJECT WHILE COMPLETING A MASTER OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH IN 2020.

This python script loads the model from aws s3 storage. To receive restricted user access to this s3 location, please e-mail Alex at alexander.nelson24@gmail.com with this request.
